# ChatterLens-Analyzing-ChatGPT-Reviews
Since its release, ChatGPT has received extensive user feedback through ratings and textual reviews. Analyzing this feedback to understand user sentiment and identify key factors influencing satisfaction or dissatisfaction is essential for refining the product and improving the overall user experience.

The key objectives I am going to focus in this notebook are:

1. Sentiment Analysis: Examine the overall sentiment distribution among users and pinpoint the specific aspects of ChatGPT that they appreciate or find lacking.
2. Time-Series Analysis: Track and evaluate how user sentiment has changed over time.
3. Issue Identification: Detect the most frequent issues users encounter, particularly those contributing to negative reviews.
4. Net Promoter Score (NPS) Analysis: Calculate and visualize the NPS over time to gauge user loyalty and their likelihood of recommending ChatGPT.
